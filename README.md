# Image Encryption

- Encrypt and Decrypt Images using XOR operations.
- Select either an image or a folder with images.
- Enter a key for encryption.
- Automatically converts encrypted to decrypted and vice versa.

Caution:

- Names of images can't be too long. There is a enumarate_images.py script in the folder if needed.
- Files can be encrypted with multiple layers, encrypting data over already encrypted files.
- If a wrong key is used for decrypting data, it will encrypt data over with the new key.
- Image file names must be short. There is a file name shortner script in the folder as well.
