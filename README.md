# Image Encryption

- Encrypt and Decrypt Images using XOR operations.
- Select either an image or a folder with images.
- Enter a key for encryption. Longer key - tougher encryption.
- 1/2 digits - 1 pass of encryption, 3/4 digits - 2 passes of encryption, 5/6 - 3 passes and so on..
- Converts encrypted to decrypted and vice versa. Mode must be specified at promt when asked.

Caution:

- ENCRYPT DATA AT YOUR OWN RISK. ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION IF NOT DONE PROPERLY COULD RESULT IN DATA LOSS.
- Files can be encrypted with multiple layers, encrypting data over already encrypted files.
- If a wrong key is used for decrypting data, it will encrypt data over with the new key.
